- [ ] **Transaction duration** measured for long-running operations

```sql

ALTER SYSTEM SET log_min_duration_statement = 1000; -- Log queries > 1 second
SELECT pg_reload_conf();

-- Find slowest queries
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, rows
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY total_time DESC 
LIMIT 10;

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT ...;
```

### ‚úÖ Index Analysis

```sql
-- Find unused indexes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE idx_tup_read = 0 AND idx_tup_fetch = 0;

-- Find missing indexes (tables with sequential scans)
SELECT schemaname, tablename, seq_scan, seq_tup_read, 
       seq_tup_read / seq_scan AS avg_seq_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE seq_scan > 100 
ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC;

-- Check index usage
SELECT tablename, indexname, idx_scan, idx_tup_read, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
```

### ‚úÖ Table and Database Statistics

```sql
-- Check table sizes
SELECT schemaname, tablename, 
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size,
       pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) as bytes
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- Check table bloat
SELECT tablename, n_dead_tup, n_live_tup, 
       round(n_dead_tup * 100.0 / (n_live_tup + n_dead_tup), 2) AS dead_ratio
FROM pg_stat_user_tables 
WHERE n_live_tup > 0
ORDER BY dead_ratio DESC;

-- Check statistics age
SELECT schemaname, tablename, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum, 
       last_analyze, last_autoanalyze
FROM pg_stat_user_tables;
```
